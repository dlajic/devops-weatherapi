# DevOps Weather API â€“ Version 1.1

## Overview

This project is a DevOps-driven, fully containerized data pipeline that automates the entire lifecycle of a weather data service from data ingestion to deployment.

It is designed to:

- Fetch weather data daily via scheduled workflows (Airflow)
- Store it persistently in a PostgreSQL database
- Expose it through an API and frontend
- Run entirely in Dockerized services
- Be deployed and updated automatically through CI/CD pipelines
- Scale to cloud environments like AWS or Railway

The goal is to simulate a real-world production system that is modular, observable, automated, and ready for deployment with minimal manual intervention.

---

## ðŸ”„ Current Features (**v1.1**)

- **FastAPI backend** with async PostgreSQL access
- **Modular architecture** for data models, routes & DB handling
- **Script-based weather data fetcher** via Airflow
- **PostgreSQL database container** (auto-created on startup)
- **Daily weather data fetch via Apache Airflow** (scheduled DAG)
- **Simple static frontend** to visualize and download the data
- **Fully containerized setup** (backend, frontend, DB, Airflow)
- **Orchestrated with `docker-compose`**
- **Internal network communication** between services
- **ENV-based config** for DB access & API keys

---

## Project Goals & Vision

This project is designed as a realistic DevOps case study with long-term scalability in mind. Beyond the current functionality, future versions will include:

- CI/CD automation via GitLab Pipelines (Linting, Tests, Build, Deploy)
- Deployment to cloud platforms (AWS EC2, Railway, Render)
- Basic monitoring with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Uptime Kuma
- Optional: Add ML component for weather trend forecasting
- Modular enough to support future extensions (e.g. Kafka, managed DBs, MLOps)

---

## Roadmap (Next Milestones)

### **v1.2**
- Set up **CI pipeline** via GitLab (.gitlab-ci.yml)
- Add **unit tests** for API & fetcher logic (pytest)
- Push images to **GitLab Container Registry**
- Prepare deployment to **cloud environment** (e.g. EC2, Railway)

### **v1.3**
- Add basic **monitoring & health checks** (e.g. Uptime Kuma, Prometheus)
- Externalize API Key handling (via `.env` or secret manager)
- Auto-deploy via GitLab CI â†’ SSH or Docker Remote

### **v2.x (Advanced Goals)**
- Switch to **managed PostgreSQL** (e.g. Railway)
- Move DAGs to **Dagster** (or enhanced Airflow setup)
- Optional: Deploy to **Kubernetes**
- Add ML component: **temperature trend forecasting**
- API public docs (e.g. via Swagger + custom frontend)

## How to Run (Development)

```bash
# Build and start the containers
docker compose up --build

# Stop all containers
docker compose down
```
